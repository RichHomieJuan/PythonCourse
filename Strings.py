#strings can be made in single or double ""

#square brackets can be used to access a portion of a string

hello= "hello world"
print(hello[0])

print(hello[0:4])
#concatenation allows us to add values together or multiply

print(hello+hello)

print(hello + " my name is Juan") #cocants hello world plus my name is juan, space after 1st "" for space when it prints.

print(hello*3) #would print hello world 3x *x meaning number of times

print("he" in "hello") #in inbetween strings tells you if true or false depending on what is placed.
#example the letter he is in hello so it proved true

print("w"in "hello") #here it proves false because the letter w is not in hello.
